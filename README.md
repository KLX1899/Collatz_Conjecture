# Collatz_Conjecture

"Hailstone Sequence", also known as the "Collatz Conjecture", you start with a positive integer and repeatedly apply the following rules:
If the number is even, divide it by 2
If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

The conjecture states that no matter what positive integer you start with, the sequence will always reach 1 eventually.
